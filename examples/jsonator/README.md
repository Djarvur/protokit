# jsonator

Quite possibly the most useless protoc-gen plugin out there.

This is just a demo to show you how to use `protokit`. All this does, is generate a single output file (`output.json`)
which contains the full name and description of each of the proto files to generate.

**Running this example**

* `go generate && cat output.json`
* :rofl:
